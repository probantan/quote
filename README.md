It is an application where the user can read quotes, delete and even like or dislike the quotes. The user can still go ahead and create their own quote if need be..And those quote can be voted.
Users can also add and delete quotes - this feature will much effective once a login system has been established  

  Users also get to see how long ago a quote was posted

  users can also upvote and downvote quotes that they like or don't like.

  A quote of the day is showed on the  top. The quote that makes it  on top shoushld have  the most upvotes.

 Users should click on the add new quote to get rid of any input before adding a new quote.

 The refresh button updates all the quotes after user adds a new one and also updates quote of the day to the current one.
